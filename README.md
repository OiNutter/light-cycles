Light Cycles (WIP)
==================

Messing around with Löve, seeing if I can implement a version of the classic
Tron Light Cycle game

Controls
--------

`SPACE` starts and resets the game

### Player 1 (Blue)
up, left, down, right = `w`,`a`,`s`,`d`

### Player 2 (Red)
up, left, down, right = `↑`, `←`, `↓`, `→`

Objective
---------

Cause your opponent to crash, either into the edge of the grid or into your
light wall, without crashing yourself.
